<h2 style = "color: white">STA 310: Generalized Linear Models</h2>

STA 310 builds upon the content in STA 210: Regression Analysis. In STA 310 students will be introduced to generalized linear models (GLMs), a broad modeling framework that includes linear and logistic models, among others. Students will learn the basic theory of GLMs and how they can used to model a variety of response variables with non-normal distributions. Students will also learn an extension of GLMs that can be applied to modeling data with correlated observations, such as data with repeated measures.
